Creation of packages includes following steps: 
1. Declare the package at the beginning of the java source code file using below syntax. 
Syntax:  
package package_name; 
Above statement should be used in the beginning of the program to include that program in that 
particular package. 

2. Define a class which is to be put in the package and declare it public. 
Example: 
package first_pkg; 
public class Hello 
{ 
  public void display() 
  { 
    System.out.println(“I am from Hello class:”); 
  } 
} 
In above example first_pkg is the package name and class Hello is added into it. 
3. Create the subdirectory which has given the same name of package and stored it into main directory 
where the source code is present. 
4. Compile the source file, after that .class file stored into the subdirectory which is created in step 3. 



 How to access package from another package/import statement: 
There are three ways to access the package from outside the package. 
1. import package.*; 
2. import package.classname; 
3. fully qualified name.

1) Using packagename.*; 
 If you use package.* statement then all the classes and interfaces of this package will be 
accessible. 
 import is a predefined keyword.  
Syntax: 
 import Package_Name.*; 
Example: 
//Save by Abc.java 
 
package first_pkg; 
 
public class Abc 
{ 
        public void display() 
 { 
  System.out.println(“I am from Abc class:”); 
 } 
} 
 
//Save by Xyz.java 
 
package second_pkg; 
import first_pkg.*; 
 
class Xyz 
{ 
        public static void main(String args[]) 
       { 
        Abc a1=new Abc(); 
        a1.display(); 
       } 
} 

Output: 
I am from Abc class
